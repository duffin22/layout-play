###Project Requirements
#######
For this project, I was tasked to create my very first Android app that runs on a real Android device! The main goal of the project was to gather knowledge in using Android Activities, Intents, Layouts & ListViews. The more specifc requirements were as follows:

- Implement a paper prototype for your app.
- Your app must contain ListViews and/or GridViews
- Your app must implement at least two Activities
- Data must be passed from one activity to another
- Users can add/edit/delete items in each list
- Display in both landscape and portrait orientations

###Step 1: Planning & Paper Prototype
#######
The first step was to formulate an idea. For me, a big part of the decision making process for each project is to push myself and learn new skills for my future career. With that in mind, I set my goal in this task to successfully utilize the user's local camera application to show images within my app.
