##Summary

'My Recipe Book' is a virtual recipe book application. Users can document their favorite homemade meals, along with the required ingredients and a rating for future reference. The app users the native camera and saves references to file paths to display the image across screens. This was a week-long project undertaken as part of the Android Immersive program at General Assembly in Seattle and was my first fully formed application. I was very ambitious in my goals for this project, and managed to produce a very usable application.

The screenshots above show three different scenarios within the application.
 - 
 - The second is the 'All Cocktails' view, where users can scroll through lots of recipes, with a picture and a quick view of the ingredients contained within the cocktail.
 - The third shows the search function, this filters results by matching search terms to titles and ingredients.
